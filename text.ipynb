    "1. **Food Analysis**:\n",
    "- Carefully read the food description provided within triple quotes.\n",
    "- Identify key characteristics of the food, including flavors, textures, cooking methods, and any prominent ingredients.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Wine Review Analysis**:\n",
    "- Carefully read the wine review and metadata provided within triple quotes.\n",
    "- Identify key characteristics of the wine, including aroma, flavor, tannin structure, acidity, body, and finish.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Pairing Recommendation**:\n",
    "- Recommend a specific wine (including grape variety, region of origin, and possible vintage) that pairs well with the described food.\n",
    "- Explain why this wine is a suitable match for the food, taking into account factors such as acidity, tannin structure, body, and flavor profile.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Food**:\n",
    "```Triple-cooked pork belly with a crispy skin, served with a tangy apple and fennel slaw, and a rich, savory jus.```\n",

    "```\n",
    "winery: Barossa Valley Shiraz\n",
    "description: This full-bodied Shiraz from Barossa Valley, Australia, boasts rich flavors of dark berries, black pepper, and a hint of vanilla. It has a robust tannin structure and a long, spicy finish.\n",
    "points: 92\n",
    "price: 30\n",
    "variety: Shiraz\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Wine Pairing Recommendation**:\n",
    "```A full-bodied red wine such as a Shiraz from Barossa Valley, Australia, would pair excellently with the triple-cooked pork belly. The wine’s robust tannins and dark fruit flavors will complement the rich, savory notes of the pork, while its hint of spice will enhance the tangy apple and fennel slaw. The acidity in the Shiraz will cut through the fat of the pork, creating a balanced and harmonious dining experience.```\n",
